# VISUAL CONFIGURATION
# This file specifies how codes should look in human-readable form.
# It is used to create the output spreadsheet showing the codes that were
# predicted for each portion in the text.
# The file contains one line per code under the header [labels].
# Each line is formatted as [machine-readable-code] | Human readable code
# Codes must also appear in the annotation.conf
# Note that the code on the left must be a single word (as in annotation.conf) and the human-readable version on the right can be multi-word.
# We do not use the [drawings] header in our CHI 2018 work.

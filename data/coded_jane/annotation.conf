# CODEBOOK CONFIGURATION
# This file lists all the codes in the codebook.
# It should be formatted according to BRAT's annotation conventions.
# Each line under the [entities] header stands for one code. 
# Multi-word codes must be joined using hyphens.
# Code hierarchies can be created using identation.
# In our CHI 2018 work, we ignore other headers 
# (relations, events, attributes).

[relations]

# Definition of (binary) relations.

# Format in brief: one relation per line, with first space-separated
# field giving the relation type and the rest of the line the
# comma-separated arguments in ROLE:TYPE format. The roles are
# typically "Arg1" and "Arg2".

#Merge1 Arg1:General, Arg2:General
#Merge2 Arg1:General, Arg2:Tenure-process
#Merge2 Arg1:Tenure-process, Arg2:General
#Merge2 Arg1:General, Arg2:When-collaborating
#Merge2 Arg1:When-collaborating, Arg2:General
#Merge3 Arg1:Tenure-process, Arg2:When-collaborating
#Merge3 Arg1:When-collaborating, Arg2:Tenure-process

[events]

# Definition of events.

# Format in brief: one event per line, with first space-separated
# field giving the event type and the rest of the line the
# comma-separated arguments in ROLE:TYPE format. Arguments may be
# specified as either optional (by appending "?" to role) or repeated
# (by appending either "*" for "0 or more" or "+" for "1 or more").

# this is a macro definition, used for brevity
#<POG>=Person|Organization|GPE

# the "!" before a type specifies that it cannot be used for annotation
# (hierarchy structure only.)

#	Be-born   Person-Arg:Person, Place-Arg?:GPE
#	Marry     Person-Arg{2}:Person, Place-Arg?:GPE

#	Merge-org  Org-Arg{2}:Organization
#	End-org    Org-Arg:Organization



[attributes]

# Definition of entity and event attributes.

# Format in brief: first tab-separated field is attribute name, second
# a set of key-value pairs. The latter must define "Arg:" which
# specifies what the attribute can attach to (typically "<EVENT>").
# If no other keys are defined, the attribute is binary (present or
# absent). If "Value:" with multiple alternatives is defined, the
# attribute can have one of the given values.

#Negation     Arg:<EVENT>
#Confidence   Arg:<EVENT>, Value:High|Neutral|Low
